# Design Patterns

## Factory

A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.

## Prototype

A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.

## Facade

Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.
