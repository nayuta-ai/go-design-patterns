# Design Patterns

## Factory

A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.

## Prototype

A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.

## Singleton

A component which is instantiated only once.

## Decorator

Facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual objects through embedding.

## Facade

Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

## Flyweight

A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects.

## Proxy

A type that functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging or some other added functionality.

## Chain of Responsibility

A chain of components who all get a chance to process a command or a query, optionally having default processing implementation and an ability to terminate the processing chain.

## Command

An object which represents an instruction to perform a particular action. Contains all the information necessary for the action to be taken.

## Interpreter

A component that processes structured text data. Does so by turning it into separate lexical tokens(lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens(parsing).

## Iterator

An object that facilitates the traversal of a data structure.

## Mediator

A component that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarily being aware of each other or having direct access to each other.

## Memento

A token representing the system state. Lets us roll back to the state when the token was generated. May or may not directly expose state information.
