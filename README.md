# Design Patterns

## Factory

A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.

## Prototype

A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.

## Decorator

Facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual objects through embedding.

## Facade

Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

## Flyweight

A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects.

## Proxy

A type that functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging or some other added functionality.
